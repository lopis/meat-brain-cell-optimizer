## Meat-based energy cell optimizer

> Your meat-brained species excels at **pattern&nbsp;recognition**, albeit through instinct rather than understanding. This experiment aims to determine if human intuition can **optimize** our multi-dimensional quintessence-fused energy cells effectively.
>
> **Do not concern yourself** with the intricacies of our technology; your fleshy brain could not begin to comprehend. Focus on **instinctively** finding the most **harmonious** parameter configurations.

## About

Synaptic Harmonics is a game designed and developed for the [GameDev.js 2024](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2024/) game jam. Moreover, this is an entry for the js13k challenge of this jam, because this whole game is under 13Kb zipped.

In a future not far away, non-human entities, far supassing our technological capabilities, have deemed our feeble meat-based brains as a potentially valuable resource. Seems like our species has evolved to identify patterns and to recognize symetry and harmony. These characteristics are actually projections of multi-dimensional effects on our 3D world and by manipulating them, we can aparently help them optimize their energy production needs.

## Game mechanics

The game takes you through a series of visual puzzles where you need to identify the most harmonious configuration of the provided controls. Reaching the best configuration will optimize the energy output and light up the 5 lamps.

## Development

If you want to build this game, simply run:

```
yarn
yarn build
yarn serve
```

Or if you want to run the dev build

```
yarn dev
```
